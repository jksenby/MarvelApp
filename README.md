# Marvel App

This is my first work with API. I chosed Marvel API because i love this universe

It is multiple page application with information about comicses and characters of Marvel Entertaiment.

I have been working on this project for 2-3 months, simultaneously studying and creating other projects, and finally i think i finished it. Recently I also thought about adding Redux, but it would be too much work, and besides, I haven't mastered this technology yet, so I can now say with confidence that this pet project is finished, and nothing else will be added.

I loaded it to Github Pages, so you can go to the website just by this linK: https://jksenby.github.io/marvelapp
